I see trees of green, red roses, too
I see them bloom, for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world.

I see skies of blue, and clouds of white,
The bright blessed day,
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself,
What a wonderful world.

The colour of the rainbow,
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces,
Of people going by

I see friends shaking hands,
Saying "How do you do?"
They're really sayin': "I love you".
